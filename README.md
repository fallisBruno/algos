### Improving problem solving skills using ChatGPT as a 'professor'

I'm always struggling in problem solving interviews, so I decided to study algorithms and problem solving,
but using ChatGPT to give me problems and to correct them, explaining about **Big O()** and what could be improved.

I'm also creating unit tests, cause I think that's gonna improve my code quality too.

As GPT is probably getting the problems from HackerRank, LeetCode or any other website, I'm googling the problem and running my solution in the 
respective website to understand the algorithm time and memory use and to check out for others solutions.

**Goal**: 30 min a day solving algorithm and also reading an algorithm book.

I've created this repository to track all that, hope it helps you if you're reading this looking for help.
