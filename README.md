### Improving problem-solving skills using ChatGPT as a 'professor'

I'm always struggling with problem-solving in interviews, 
so I decided to study algorithms and improve my problem-solving skills by using 
ChatGPT to provide problems, correct my solutions, and explain concepts like **Big O()** and potential improvements.

I'm also creating unit tests because I believe that will improve my code quality as well.

Since GPT is likely sourcing the problems from **HackerRank**, **LeetCode**, or other websites, I often Google the problem and run my solution on the respective platform to evaluate time and memory usage and to check out other people's solutions.

**Goal: 30 minutes a day solving algorithms and reading an algorithm book.**

I created this repository to track all my progress. I hope it helps you if you're reading this and looking for guidance.
