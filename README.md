~~### Improving problem-solving skills using ChatGPT as a 'professor'~~

~~I'm always struggling with problem-solving in interviews, 
so I decided to study algorithms and improve my problem-solving skills by using 
ChatGPT to provide problems, correct my solutions, and explain concepts like **Big O()** and potential improvements.~~

~~I'm also creating unit tests because I believe that will improve my code quality as well.~~

~~Since GPT is likely sourcing the problems from **HackerRank**, **LeetCode**, or other websites, I often Google the problem and run my solution on the respective platform to evaluate time and memory usage and to check out other people's solutions.~~

**Goal: 30 minutes a day solving algorithms and reading an algorithm book.**

I created this repository to track all my progress. I hope it helps you if you're reading this and looking for guidance.

It turns out that GPT wasn't a good professor, but still really good to understand algorithm complexity, extra space and for problem explanation, so now I decided to plan better my studies instead of solving random problem on LeetCode.
I've found the following problem-solving roadmap on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/147kdt7/roadmap_to_become_very_very_good/

Current study plan:
- [ ] Solve Blind75 list.
- [ ] NeetCode 150
- [ ] NeetCode All
- [ ] Do hard problems with some of the less frequent but still somewhat common data structures, like Union Find, Binary Index Tree, etc. (can search LC problems by tag)
- [ ] LC Google question set
- [ ] Browse USACO guide and identify any gaps

The above list can change, but for now this is what I'm gonna follow.
